                    <p> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; Vikram Sarabhai was an award-winning physicist, 
                        industrialist and innovator. 
                        Considered the Father of the Indian space programme, 
                        Sarabhai is also credited with establishing Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro). </p>

                    <p> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; Born to wealthy industrialists in the city of Ahmedabad in Gujarat
                         on August 12, 1919, Vikram Sarabhai earned
                         his doctorate from Cambridge University. During his time at Cambridge, 
                         he studied cosmic rays and published many research papers on it. After returning to India,
                         he founded the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) in Ahmedabad on November 11, 1947,
                          when he was 28 years old. </p>

                    <p> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; After PRL, Sarabhai set up the Space Applications Centre in Ahmedabad, 
                        and guided the establishment of Isro.</p>

                    <p> &emsp; &emsp;&emsp; After the launch of Russia’s Sputnik satellite, 
                        Sarabhai felt the need for India to have a space agency as well.
                         He convinced the Indian government to start the Indian National 
                         Committee for Space Research (Incospar) programme with the following quote: </p>

                    <p> &emsp; &emsp;&emsp; "There are some who question the relevance of space activities in a developing nation. 
                        To us, there is no ambiguity of purpose. 
                        We do not have the fantasy of competing with the economically advanced nations in the 
                        exploration of the moon or the planets or manned space flight. 
                        But we are convinced that if we are to play a meaningful role nationally, 
                        and in the community of nations, we must be second to none in the application of 
                        advanced technologies to the real problems of man and society." </p>

                    <p> &emsp; &emsp;&emsp;His vision and commitment led to the establishment of Inscopar 
                        during the Nehru government. 
                        It was later re-christened the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro). </p>

                    <p> &emsp; &emsp;&emsp; Vikram Sarabhai helped Homi Bhabha set up India's first rocket-launching station, 
                        which was built in St Mary Magdalene Church near Thiruvanathapuram. 
                        The first flight was a sodium vapour payload and was launched on 21 November 1963. </p>

                    <p> &emsp; &emsp;&emsp; Sarabhai started a project that would lead to the building 
                        of India’s first artificial satellite orbiting the earth. 
                        Launched in July 1976, the Aryabhata was launched four years after the 
                        death of Sarabhai on the Kapustin Yar, a Russian rocket.</p>

                    <p> &emsp; &emsp;&emsp;He set up India's first market research organisation that 
                        aimed to apply modern analytical research to meet the needs of clients.
                         The organisation was called Operations Research Group.</p>
